<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* Create a Terminal game with clear playing instructions
* Going to replicate a classic, Space Invaders!
* Needs to adhere to the 4 pillars of OOP design and include an interface, Abstract class, Lambda expression, 
and a stream. Should also include error handling for incorrect user inputs.
* 
*
*
*
*
<h2>2. Planning the Solution</h2>
* Will use Swing for GUI
* Objects needed: Our ship, Alien ships, shots fired from both, Alien army.
* Will also need to keep score, to draw the objects, a landing page for instructions and to start the game.
* Would like to have a pause game function and restart function. Various levels of difficulty??
* Classes needed: <br/>
    spaceinvaders.Main <br/>
    ShipShot (Abstract...?) -> Alien Shot/Ship shot <br/>
    Alien <br/>
    Alien army <br/>
    Draw (for GUI output) <br/>
    perhaps more (Score, Move Army?) ... 
* Not sure where to implement the lambda, interface, or stream... will need updating
* 
*
<h2>3. Executing the Plan</h2>
* Starting from a tutorial and refactoring to meet the needs.
* Most of this is going to be the Guess and check to create the design...
* The refactoring was a much more arduous task than I had originally thought... 
*
*
*
*
*
<h2>4. Reflection / Refactor</h2>
* I should have talked to someone about the design and trusted my abilities in java to get it done instead of going
 through the tutorial first.
* I also should have scrapped the tutorial code and started from scratch instead of refactoring, the refactoring
 took way too much time and left me with a broken and incomplete project come due date. 
* I am really disappointed with how much is left to get the refactoring back to a working game and design I had
 in mind.
